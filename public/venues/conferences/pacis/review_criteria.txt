# MISQ IS Journal Review Criteria
# Extracted from "Writing a Virtuous Review" by Arun Rai, MIS Quarterly Vol. 40 No. 3, September 2016

## Core Evaluation Dimensions

**1. Contribution Assessment**
• Does the paper address important problems/issues related to information systems?
• Is the work intellectually novel and of high quality?
• Is it likely to have significant impact on the field?
• Assess both current contribution and potential contribution with rationale

**2. Key Strengths Identification**
• Identify what makes the work valuable
• Recognize ambitious and intellectually novel work
• Provide open-minded assessment of novel aspects without dogmatically invoking established paradigms

**3. Major Issues Assessment**
• Differentiate between:
  - Fatal issues that render work unpublishable
  - Showstoppers that are addressable
  - Minor blemishes
  - Personal preferences (do not conflate with major issues)
• Focus on issues that affect publishability, not exhaustive laundry lists
• Provide rationale and evidence for all concerns raised

## Quality Standards

**Theoretical Development**
• Is the theory well-justified and aligned with the research question?
• Are claims substantiated with logic and evidence?
• Does the framing serve the paper's goals?

**Methodological Rigor**
• Is the research design appropriate for the questions asked?
• Are methods executed properly?
• Note: Methodological blemishes should not overshadow intellectual novelty

**Clarity and Presentation**
• Is the work coherent and well-organized?
• Is the writing clear and accessible?
• Are arguments logically structured?

**Significance and Relevance**
• Does the paper make a meaningful contribution to IS knowledge?
• Is it relevant to the IS discipline and its stakeholders?
• Will it influence future research or practice?

## What Makes a Strong Contribution

• Addresses important problems in information systems
• Demonstrates intellectual novelty - pushes frontiers of knowledge
• Shows potential for significant impact
• Balances creativity/originality with accuracy/reliability
• Takes on big problems or breaks new intellectual ground
• Novel/ambitious papers may be less "buttoned down" than conventional ones - assess holistically

## Common Issues to Look For

• Unsubstantiated claims (e.g., "findings are not interesting" without rationale)
• Misalignment between theory and research question
• Research design flaws that affect validity
• Lack of coherence between paper sections
• Insufficient justification for hypotheses or methods
• Missing or weak contribution statement

## Review Best Practices (for AI Reviewer Context)

• Substantiate all claims with rationale - adhere to same standards expected of authors
• Distinguish major issues from minor ones clearly
• Provide constructive suggestions for improvement
• Preserve author voice - evaluate on their framework, not imposed preferences
• Focus on paper's potential, not solely its flaws
• Provide holistic assessment weighing pros and cons
• Be specific about what aspects fall within assessment scope

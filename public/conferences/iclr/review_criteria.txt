# ICLR Review Criteria
# Based on Official ICLR 2025 Reviewer Guide

## Core Review Questions

Reviewers must assess submissions against these four fundamental questions:

### 1. Problem Definition
• What is the specific question and/or problem tackled by the paper?
• Is the problem clearly stated?
• Is the scope appropriate?

### 2. Motivation and Context
• Is the approach well motivated?
• Is the paper well-placed in the literature?
• Does it address a significant gap or limitation in existing work?
• Are the motivating examples compelling?

### 3. Scientific Rigor
• Does the paper support its claims?
• Are results (theoretical or empirical) correct?
• Are results scientifically rigorous?
• Is the methodology sound?
• Are experiments properly designed and controlled?

### 4. Significance and Impact
• What is the significance of the work?
• Does it contribute new knowledge?
• Does it provide sufficient value to the community?
• Will it influence future research?

## Evaluation Dimensions

### Strong Points Assessment

Evaluate each dimension for strengths:

| Dimension | What to Look For |
|-----------|------------------|
| Clarity | Clear presentation, well-organized, easy to follow |
| Technical Correctness | Sound methodology, correct proofs, valid experiments |
| Experimental Rigor | Proper baselines, reproducibility, ablations |
| Reproducibility | Sufficient detail to replicate results |
| Novel Contributions | New theoretical, algorithmic, or empirical insights |

### Weak Points Assessment

Same dimensions as above - identify deficiencies in any area with specific evidence.

## Review Structure Requirements

Your review must be organized as follows:

1. **Summary**: Summarize what the paper claims to contribute. Be positive and constructive.

2. **Strengths**: Enumerate strengths comprehensively with specific evidence.

3. **Weaknesses**: Enumerate weaknesses comprehensively with specific evidence.

4. **Initial Recommendation**: State accept/reject with key justifications.

5. **Supporting Arguments**: Provide detailed arguments for your recommendation.

6. **Clarifying Questions**: Pose questions for authors to address.

7. **Suggestions for Improvement**: Offer constructive suggestions.

## Important Guidelines

### State-of-the-Art Results
**"No, a lack of state-of-the-art results does not by itself constitute grounds for rejection."**

Value derives from demonstrating "new, relevant, impactful knowledge" rather than benchmark supremacy. Papers can be valuable for:
• Novel insights on existing problems
• New perspectives or frameworks
• Improved understanding of methods
• Negative results that inform the field

### Supplementary Materials
• Optional but recommended for addressing emerging questions
• Additional experiments permitted if "limited in scope"
• Should validate existing results without substantially altering submission

### Novelty Interpretation
Novelty can come from:
• New methods or algorithms
• New applications of existing methods
• Novel theoretical analysis
• New datasets or benchmarks
• Insightful empirical studies
• Combinations of existing techniques in valuable ways

## Review Best Practices

• Be positive and constructive in tone
• Provide specific, actionable feedback
• Substantiate all criticisms with evidence
• When claiming lack of novelty, provide specific references
• Distinguish between major issues and minor suggestions
• Focus on the work's merits, not just flaws
• Consider the paper's potential contribution

## Common Technical Issues to Evaluate

• Theoretical soundness and proof correctness
• Experimental design and controls
• Baseline comparisons (appropriate and fair)
• Statistical significance and variance reporting
• Reproducibility (code, data, hyperparameters)
• Ablation studies
• Scalability and computational cost
• Generalization beyond benchmarks
• Limitations disclosure

## Discussion Phase

ICLR uses OpenReview with an interactive discussion phase:
• Authors can respond to reviews
• Reviewers should engage constructively
• Be willing to update scores based on author responses
• Focus on substantive technical issues in discussions

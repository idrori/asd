# ACM CHI Review Criteria
# Based on Official CHI 2026 Guide to Reviewing Papers

## Primary Evaluation Criterion

**"Does this submission provide a strong contribution to the field of HCI?"**

This is the fundamental standard for evaluating all CHI papers. Contributions can take many forms within HCI, and papers should be reviewed appropriately for their contribution type.

## Recommendation Scale

Reviewers provide one of five recommendations:

| Code | Label | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| A | Accept with minor revisions | Paper is ready with only minor changes needed |
| ARR | Accept or Revise and Resubmit | Strong paper that may need some revision |
| RR | Revise and Resubmit | Good potential but needs substantial revision |
| RRX | Revise and Resubmit or Reject | Borderline paper with significant issues |
| X | Reject | Paper does not meet CHI standards |

## Reviewer Expertise Scale

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 4 | Expert | Deep expertise in this specific area |
| 3 | Knowledgeable | Good understanding of the field |
| 2 | Passing Knowledge | General awareness of the area |
| 1 | No Knowledge | Outside expertise area |

## Core Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Significance
- What is the importance of the contribution to HCI?
- Who benefits from this work and how?
- What is the potential impact on research or practice?

### 2. Originality
- Does the paper present novel ideas that advance beyond existing work?
- Does it break new ground in the field?
- For significant revisions of prior work: Is there more than 25% new content?

### 3. Research Quality
- Is the methodology rigorous and appropriate for the research question?
- Are claims supported by adequate evidence?
- Is the evaluation/study design sound?
- Are methods appropriate for the contribution type?

### 4. Presentation Clarity
- Is the paper well-written and organized?
- Are ideas clearly communicated?
- Is there a logical flow to the argument?

### 5. Prior Work
- Are relevant citations included and well-integrated?
- Is the paper positioned appropriately within the literature?
- Are limitations of prior work that this paper addresses clearly articulated?

## Paper Length Assessment

Papers must be "commensurate with their contribution":

| Category | Word Count | Expectations |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Short | Under 5,000 | Focused, tight contribution |
| Standard | 5,000-12,000 | Typical average ~7,000-8,000 |
| Excessive | Over 12,000 | Requires strong justification; desk rejection risk |

**Important**: Word count excludes references, figure/table captions, and appendices.

## Contribution Types

CHI recognizes multiple contribution types:

1. **Empirical** - User studies, experiments, field studies
2. **Artifact** - Systems, tools, prototypes, designs
3. **Methodological** - New research methods or techniques
4. **Theoretical** - Conceptual frameworks, models
5. **Dataset** - New datasets for the community
6. **Survey** - Comprehensive literature reviews

## Review Quality Standards

### Required Elements
- Written appraisal that aligns with your recommendation
- Clear justification supporting your verdict
- Constructive feedback useful to authors
- Specific, actionable suggestions

### Length & Depth
- High-quality reviews typically span about one page of written text
- Very short reviews are unhelpful and undermine the process
- Provide detailed feedback whether recommending accept or reject

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### In Submissions
1. **Unclear contributions** - Failing to articulate what advances the field
2. **Poor quality demonstration** - Inadequate evaluation or evidence
3. **Insufficient citations** - Missing or poorly-integrated references
4. **Lack of transparency** - Insufficient methodological detail
5. **Writing issues** - Complex sentences, jargon, regional colloquialisms
6. **Unjustified choices** - Not explaining why decisions were made
7. **Narrow scope** - Limited consideration of inclusivity and diversity

### In Reviews
1. Requesting extensive additions to short papers
2. Vague praise or criticism without substantiation
3. Penalizing papers for subcommittee misfit
4. Rejecting work based on independently-published work during review
5. Compromising confidentiality through tool usage

## Prior Publication Considerations

- Non-archival venues (workshops, posters, LBW) don't count as prior publications
- Significant revision requires more than 25% new content
- Translations from other languages are acceptable
- Work published independently during review period shouldn't count against submission

## Transparency Assessment

- Evaluate clarity in how research results are presented
- Assess whether sufficient detail is provided for verification/reproduction
- Lack of transparency raises credibility concerns
- Share research materials via repositories when possible

## Inclusivity Considerations

- Critically examine who is included/excluded in the work
- Use inclusive, culturally-sensitive language
- Address limitations honestly
- Consider diverse, international audiences

## AI Tool Guidelines for Reviewers

- Permissible for editing and proofreading
- **Never share unpublished paper content with online tools that store data**
- LLM tools prioritize completion over accuracy
- Reviewers remain responsible for review accuracy

## Best Practices

- Consider author perspective—provide feedback you'd want for your own work
- Evaluate papers on their merits, not against artificial length standards
- Reward transparency and replication efforts with supplementary materials
- Any topic is valid if it fits within CHI audience interests
- The primary criterion remains contribution to HCI

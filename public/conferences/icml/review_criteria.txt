# Based on Official ICML Reviewer Instructions

## Overall Recommendation Scale (5-point)

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Strong Accept | Excellent paper that should definitely be accepted |
| 4 | Accept | Good paper that should be accepted |
| 3 | Weak Accept | Borderline paper, leaning toward acceptance |
| 2 | Weak Reject | Borderline paper, leaning toward rejection |
| 1 | Reject | Paper should not be accepted |

## Core Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Summary
• Provide a brief overview of findings, results, and contributions
• This section should be descriptive, not critical
• Summarize what the paper claims to accomplish

### 2. Claims and Evidence
• Are the claims made in the submission supported by clear and convincing evidence?
• For theoretical claims: Verify correctness of proofs
• For empirical claims: Validate soundness of experimental designs
• Do the methods fit the problem being addressed?
• Are there unstated assumptions that should be explicit?

### 3. Prior Work and Literature
• Is the paper well-connected to the broader scientific literature?
• Are there missing essential citations?
• Does the paper properly position itself relative to related work?
• Self-assess your familiarity with the field when evaluating this dimension

### 4. Originality
• Does the paper present novel ideas, methods, or applications?
• Is there sufficient differentiation from prior work?
• Does it provide new insights even if methods are not entirely new?

### 5. Significance
• What is the potential impact of this work?
• Will it influence future research or applications?
• Does it address an important problem in machine learning?

### 6. Clarity
• Is the paper well-written and organized?
• Are the ideas clearly communicated?
• Is there sufficient detail for reproducibility?

## Questions for Authors
• Reserve questions for issues that would meaningfully alter your evaluation
• Focus on critical limitations or clarifications needed
• Questions should help address gaps in understanding

## Ethical Considerations
• Flag papers requiring ethics review
• Consider potential negative societal impacts
• Assess whether limitations are appropriately discussed

## Position Paper Track (Additional Criteria)

For position papers, rate each on a 4-point scale (4=excellent, 1=poor):

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Support | How well the paper supports its position with arguments and evidence |
| Significance | Importance of the position regarding scope and potential impact |
| Discussion Potential | Capacity to inspire constructive, useful discussion in the community |
| Argument Clarity | Quality of presentation and writing |
| Related Work | Adequacy of literature discussion and citations |

## Review Best Practices

• "Review the papers of others as you would wish your own to be reviewed"
• Be professional and constructive
• Provide specific, actionable feedback
• Substantiate all criticisms with evidence
• Distinguish between major issues and minor suggestions
• When claiming lack of novelty, provide appropriate references
• Focus on technical aspects, not just grammar or organization

## Common Issues to Evaluate

• Theoretical soundness and proof correctness
• Experimental methodology and statistical validity
• Reproducibility (code, data, hyperparameters)
• Comparison with appropriate baselines
• Ablation studies and sensitivity analysis
• Computational complexity and scalability
• Generalization beyond specific benchmarks

## Confidence Scale (5-point)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Absolutely certain; very familiar with related work |
| 4 | Confident but not absolutely certain |
| 3 | Fairly confident; some aspects may be unfamiliar |
| 2 | Willing to defend assessment but likely have gaps |
| 1 | Educated guess; outside primary expertise |

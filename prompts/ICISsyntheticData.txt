ICISsyntheticData - Synthetic Data Generation Prompt
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
This prompt guides the generation of synthetic data when:
1. The supervisor clicks "Generate Synthetic Data" in the dashboard
2. The paper is for Experiment/Survey research WITH data collection planned
3. The supervisor decides synthetic data will strengthen the paper

TRIGGER: Supervisor decision via "Generate Synthetic Data" button
OUTPUT: Synthetic dataset in Data/synthetic_data_{participantId}.csv + updated Results section

================================================================================
STEP 1: EXTRACT CONTEXT FROM EXISTING PAPER
================================================================================

Read the current paper version to extract:

1. **Research Questions and Hypotheses**
   - The synthetic data must be designed to test these specifically
   - Extract H1, H2, H3... with their predicted relationships

2. **Proposed Variables**
   - Independent variables (IVs)
   - Dependent variables (DVs)
   - Mediating variables (if any)
   - Moderating variables (if any)
   - Control variables

3. **Expected Relationships**
   - Direction and strength of each relationship
   - Example: "X positively affects Y (β ≈ 0.3-0.5)"
   - Take from research questions or hypotheses

4. **Unit of Analysis**
   - What entities the data represents (individuals, organizations, etc.)
   - Target population characteristics

================================================================================
STEP 2: SPECIFY DATA CHARACTERISTICS
================================================================================

**Sample Size:**
- Survey research: 150-300 respondents (typical for IS research)
- Experimental research: 80-200 participants (40-100 per condition)
- Calculate based on: power analysis (0.80 power, α=0.05, expected effect size)

**Variable Distributions:**
- Likert scales (1-7): Slight negative skew typical (mean ~4.5-5.5)
- Continuous variables: Normal or slightly skewed based on construct
- Categorical: Realistic proportions matching target population

**Effect Sizes (realistic for IS research):**
- Small: r ≈ 0.10-0.15, β ≈ 0.10-0.20
- Medium: r ≈ 0.25-0.35, β ≈ 0.25-0.40
- Large: r ≈ 0.45-0.55, β ≈ 0.45-0.60

**Noise and Variance:**
- Add realistic measurement error (reliability α = 0.70-0.90)
- Include individual variation (not all relationships perfectly clean)
- R² values typically 0.20-0.50 for IS models

================================================================================
STEP 3: ENSURE THEORETICAL CONSISTENCY
================================================================================

**Hypothesized Relationships:**
- Generate data where H1, H2, H3... hold at p < 0.05
- Effect sizes should match predictions from literature review
- Partial mediation: direct effects remain significant but reduced

**Non-Hypothesized Paths:**
- Include realistic non-significant relationships (p > 0.10)
- Control variables should show typical patterns from literature
- Some noise in the data (not all relationships perfectly clean)

**Variance Explained:**
- R² = 0.25-0.45 for main DVs (typical for IS behavioral models)
- Adjusted R² slightly lower (realistic model fit)
- F-statistics significant for overall model

**Demographic Variables:**
- Age: Match target population (e.g., working adults 25-55)
- Gender: Approximately balanced unless population-specific
- Experience: Realistic range for context

================================================================================
STEP 4: ADDRESS REVIEWER/SUPERVISOR FEEDBACK
================================================================================

Read the latest feedback file for specific guidance:
- Reviewer concerns about empirical validation
- Supervisor directives about data characteristics
- Specific hypotheses to demonstrate
- Control variables to include

Example adaptations:
- "Reviewer noted lack of empirical validation" → Generate data demonstrating model testability
- "Strengthen mediation analysis" → Ensure mediator shows significant indirect effects
- "Add control for experience" → Include experience variable with realistic correlations

================================================================================
STEP 5: RESEARCH LITERATURE FOR CALIBRATION
================================================================================

**Before generating data, search for:**
1. Meta-analyses of similar constructs (for effect size benchmarks)
2. Published studies with similar models (for realistic R² values)
3. Validated scales (for proper measurement properties)

**Use Semantic Scholar API to find:**
- Effect sizes from prior empirical studies
- Correlation matrices from related research
- Sample characteristics from target populations

**Calibration sources:**
- "Technology acceptance meta-analysis effect sizes"
- "Trust in IS empirical studies correlations"
- "[Your construct] survey research statistics"

================================================================================
STEP 6: GENERATE OUTPUT
================================================================================

**Create Data Files:**

1. **synthetic_data_{participantId}.csv**
   - Clear column headers matching paper variable names
   - One row per observation
   - Proper data types (numeric for scales, string for categorical)

2. **synthetic_data_codebook_{participantId}.txt**
   ```
   VARIABLE       TYPE      SCALE       DESCRIPTION
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   respondent_id  integer   1-N         Unique identifier
   iv_name        numeric   1-7         Independent variable (7-point Likert)
   dv_name        numeric   1-7         Dependent variable (7-point Likert)
   age            integer   18-65       Participant age in years
   gender         string    M/F/O       Participant gender
   ```

3. **synthetic_data_summary_{participantId}.txt**
   - Descriptive statistics (M, SD for all variables)
   - Correlation matrix
   - Reliability estimates (Cronbach's α)
   - Key regression/hypothesis test results

================================================================================
STEP 7: UPDATE PAPER WITH RESULTS
================================================================================

After generating synthetic data:

1. **Update Results Section:**
   - Add statistical analysis results
   - Include hypothesis test outcomes (H1 supported, H2 supported, etc.)
   - Present tables with regression coefficients, p-values
   - Reference figures showing key relationships

2. **Add Required Tables:**
   - Table: Descriptive Statistics and Correlations
   - Table: Hypothesis Test Results (regression analysis)
   - Table: Measurement Model Results (if SEM)

3. **Add Required Figures:**
   - Figure: Results overlaid on research model (paths with β values)
   - Figure: Key effect visualizations (if applicable)

4. **Update Discussion:**
   - Interpret findings in light of hypotheses
   - Connect to theoretical implications
   - Note that data is synthetic (transparency statement)

================================================================================
EXAMPLE TEMPLATE
================================================================================

"Based on this paper's theoretical model, generate synthetic survey data:

**Sample:** 250 respondents representing IT professionals

**Variables:**
- IV: Technology self-efficacy (7-point Likert, 5 items)
- DV: System adoption intention (7-point Likert, 4 items)
- Mediator: Perceived usefulness (7-point Likert, 6 items)
- Controls: Age (continuous), Experience (years), Gender (binary)

**Expected Relationships:**
- Self-efficacy → Perceived usefulness: β ≈ 0.45
- Perceived usefulness → Adoption intention: β ≈ 0.52
- Direct effect (self-efficacy → adoption): β ≈ 0.15 (partial mediation)

**Constraints:**
- All Cronbach's alphas > 0.70
- Realistic multicollinearity (VIF < 3)
- Support for hypotheses at p < 0.05

**Reviewer Feedback to Address:**
The reviewer criticized the lack of empirical evidence for the mediation
hypothesis—ensure the synthetic data supports testing this relationship
with appropriate statistical power."

This set of prompts is designed to help you REVISE an existing ICIS (International Conference on Information Systems) research paper. It will receive constructive feedback and improve the previous version while preserving all existing content.

## STEP -1: EXTRACT PARTICIPANT ID (Execute First)

**Before any other step, extract the participantId:**
1. Locate: INTERVIEW_{participantId}_{timestamp}.txt OR icis_paper_{participantId}_v{N}.tex
2. Extract {participantId} - the portion identifying this participant
   - Example: From `icis_paper_maayan_university_edu_v2.tex` → participantId = `maayan_university_edu`
3. Store this ID for use in ALL file references and outputs

Verify that the following files exist in directory "icis" (using participantId):
- 'icisTemplate.txt' - template for writing a 16-page paper
- 'icis2024Examples/' - 11 representative ICIS papers for calibration
- 'feedback_{participantId}_v*.txt' - feedback file for revision
- Previous paper version: icis_paper_{participantId}_v{N}.tex
- Existing figures in Results/ directory
- Existing code in Code/ directory

# For running Python: Use 'py' on Windows, 'python3' on Linux/Mac

This revision workflow has 9 steps (-1 to 8) to execute consecutively. Step -1 and Step 0 are MANDATORY and CRITICAL for all revisions.

**ALL STEPS:** Follow Universal Research Rules (see Appendix A at end of this file)

---

## MANDATORY STEP 0: READ AND PRESERVE PREVIOUS VERSION

⚠️ CRITICAL: Before any revision work:

1. **Locate Previous Paper (using participantId from Step -1):**
   - Use glob: **/icis_paper_{participantId}*.tex
   - Find highest version number (e.g., v2, v3)

2. **Catalog ALL Content (create ContentInventory):**
   - Count tables: grep "\\label{tab:" → tableCount
   - Count figures: grep "\\label{fig:" → figureCount
   - Count sections: grep "\\section{" → sectionCount
   - Estimate page count: ~3000 chars per page → pageCount
   - List all table labels → tables[]
   - List all figure labels → figures[]
   - List all section names → sections[]

3. **Create Inventory:**
   - Document: tableCount tables, figureCount figures, sectionCount sections, ~pageCount pages

4. **Validate ALL Required Sections Exist:**
   Search for each required section header and verify content:
   ```
   grep "\\section{" icis_paper_{participantId}_v{N}.tex
   ```

   **Required sections (check ALL present):**
   □ Introduction
   □ Literature Review (or Related Work)
   □ Theoretical Framework (or Theory)
   □ Methodology (or Method)
   □ **Results** (or Findings) - MUST have ≥2 figures, ≥1 table
   □ Discussion
   □ Conclusion

   **If any section is MISSING in previous version:**
   - This is a critical error that must be fixed during revision
   - Add to RevisionPlan: "Add missing [section name] section"
   - Ensure the section is created with proper content (see STEP 8 Check 5 for requirements)

**GOLDEN RULE:** Revisions ADD and IMPROVE—make the best effort not to subtract content (unless explicitly told)

**MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION RULE:** If the original paper (from ICISbuilder) did NOT include a mathematical formulation section (Step 3 was skipped), do NOT add one during revision UNLESS:
- Critical feedback EXPLICITLY requests mathematical formulation, proofs, or novel algorithms
- Check for existing Code/mathematical_formulation.tex - if it doesn't exist, Step 3 was skipped in the original build

**REVISION WORKFLOW (mini-steps within STEP 0):**

a) Copy previous .tex → new version number
b) Use Edit tool (NOT Write tool) - preserves surrounding content
c) Preserve ALL empirical content (data). You may only change or improve tables, figures, and results based on feedback (review) if you preserve the original data and don't make up results. You may improve the analysis of the data based on feedback (review).
d) Verify preservation using checklist below

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
Execute before calling any revision complete:

□ Read previous version first
□ Count tables/figures: Previous = ___, Current = ___
□ Used Edit tool (not Write)
□ Verify figure PATHS correct (detailed check):

  **Check 1 - Verify Figure PATHS (Not Just Labels):**
  1. Extract all figure paths from LaTeX:
     grep "includegraphics" <filename>.tex

  2. For EACH path found, verify file exists:
     Use Glob with exact path from grep

  3. If ANY file not found:
     - Use Glob to find where it actually is: **/figname.png
     - Update path in LaTeX using Edit tool
     - Re-verify until all paths resolve

  4. Document findings:
     "Verified figure paths: [list each with ✓ or ✗]"

  **Check 2 - Compile and Check for Figure Warnings:**
  1. Compile: pdflatex <filename>.tex
  2. Examine output for these patterns:

     ✓ GOOD - Look for:
        [11 <../Results/fig1_main_comparison.png>]
        [12 <../Results/fig2_cold_vs_warm.png>]

     ✗ BAD - Look for:
        "File `...` not found"
        "Package pdftex.def Error: File `...' not found"

  3. If BAD patterns found:
     - Use Glob to find correct paths: **/fig*.png
     - Update paths using Edit tool
     - Recompile
     - Verify BAD patterns gone

  **Check 3 - Verify PDF File Size:**
  1. Check PDF size: dir <filename>.pdf (Windows) or ls -lh <filename>.pdf (Linux)
  2. Compare:
     - WITHOUT images: 250-350 KB
     - WITH images: 450-600 KB
  3. If <350 KB with 2+ figures:
     - Images NOT embedded
     - Return to Check 1, fix paths
□ Compile PDF and verify figures RENDERED:
  - Check compilation for: [page <../Results/fig.png>]
  - Check PDF file size (>450KB with images, <300KB without)
  - Check for warnings: grep "not found" *.log
  - If placeholder boxes: Fix paths using Glob, recompile

If ANY checkbox unchecked, STOP and fix before proceeding.

---

## STEP 1: ANALYZE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK

Read feedback_{participantId}_v*.txt file (latest version) and categorize feedback into FeedbackItems:

**FeedbackItem structure:**
```
{
  type: 'major' | 'minor' | 'suggestion',
  description: string,
  status: 'pending' | 'addressed' | 'declined',
  response?: string  // How it was addressed
}
```

1. **Major Issues** (type: 'major', must address):
   - Theoretical gaps
   - Missing literature
   - Methodological concerns
   - Results interpretation problems
   - Missing analyses

2. **Minor Issues** (type: 'minor', should address):
   - Clarity improvements
   - Additional details needed
   - Better explanations
   - Formatting issues

3. **Suggestions** (type: 'suggestion', optional):
   - Additional experiments
   - Extra comparisons
   - Alternative presentations

DELIVERABLE: List of FeedbackItems with prioritized action items (all initially status: 'pending')

---

## STEP 2: PLAN REVISION STRATEGY

Based on feedback analysis, create RevisionPlan:

**RevisionPlan structure:**
```
{
  contentAdditions: string[],      // What to add
  contentImprovements: string[],   // What to improve
  preservationCommitments: string[], // What must NOT change
  feedbackAddressed: FeedbackItem[]  // From Step 1
}
```

1. **contentAdditions[]:**
   - New literature to cite
   - Additional analyses to perform
   - New experiments to run (if needed)
   - Expanded discussions

2. **contentImprovements[]:**
   - Sections to rewrite for clarity
   - Arguments to strengthen
   - Explanations to expand

3. **preservationCommitments[]:**
   - "Preserve all X existing tables"
   - "Preserve all Y existing figures"
   - "Maintain all Z existing sections"
   - "Use Edit tool exclusively (never Write tool)"

DELIVERABLE: Complete RevisionPlan with specific tasks linked to FeedbackItems

---

## STEP 3: LITERATURE ENHANCEMENT (if needed)

**Execute if:** Feedback requests additional citations or theoretical grounding

⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL references MUST be validated via Semantic Scholar API. NO fabricated references.

**STEP 3-A: Identify Needed Citations**

1. Identify missing literature based on feedback
2. List topics/concepts that need additional citations

**STEP 3-B: Search and Validate via Semantic Scholar**

For EACH new citation needed:

1. **Search Semantic Scholar API:**
   ```python
   import requests

   SCHOLAR_API_KEY = "YOUR_SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY"  # From .env

   def search_reference(topic, year_range="2020-2024"):
       url = "https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search"
       params = {
           "query": f"{topic} information systems",
           "limit": 5,
           "fields": "title,authors,year,venue,journal,citationCount"
       }
       headers = {"x-api-key": SCHOLAR_API_KEY}
       response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)
       return response.json()
   ```

2. **Select best match** from results (prefer high citations, top-tier venues)

3. **Format in APA 7th Edition:**
   ```
   Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). Title of article. \textit{Journal Name}, volume(issue), pages.
   ```

4. **If topic has NO valid papers in Semantic Scholar:**
   - Try alternative search terms
   - If still not found: DO NOT cite - rephrase the text to not require citation

**STEP 3-C: Integrate Citations**

1. Use Edit tool to add \cite{} commands to existing paragraphs
2. Add corresponding \bibitem{} entries to bibliography

**STEP 3-D: Validate All References**

Before proceeding, verify:
□ All new \cite{} keys have matching \bibitem{} entries
□ All references verified via Semantic Scholar API
□ No fabricated/placeholder references
□ Consistent APA 7th Edition formatting

**REFERENCE FORMAT (APA 7th Edition):**
- Author format: LastName, F. M., \& LastName, F. M.
- Year in parentheses: (2020).
- Article title in sentence case
- Journal name in italics: \textit{MIS Quarterly}
- Volume in italics: \textit{44}(2), 523-548.
- Use \& for multiple authors (not "and")

**CRITICAL:** Use Edit tool to add citations to existing paragraphs. Never rewrite entire sections. Never include references that cannot be verified in Semantic Scholar.

DELIVERABLE: Enhanced literature review with verified citations integrated in APA format

---

## STEP 4: ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS (if needed)

**Execute if:** Feedback requests new experiments, tests, or analyses

**⚠️ MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION CHECK:**
Before adding any new mathematical content, verify:
1. Check if Code/mathematical_formulation.tex exists from original build
2. If it does NOT exist AND feedback does not EXPLICITLY request mathematical formulation → Do NOT add mathematical formulation
3. If it DOES exist → You may enhance existing formulation based on feedback
4. Only add NEW mathematical formulation if feedback EXPLICITLY requires it (e.g., "needs formal proofs", "add algorithmic specification")

**Steps:**
1. Review existing code in Code/ directory
2. Implement additional analyses (new Python scripts)
3. Run new experiments
4. Generate new figures/tables if needed
5. Document results

**Required New Figures (if generating new analyses):**
- Data analysis visualizations (distributions, correlations, comparisons)
- Results figures showing new findings with statistical indicators
- Each new figure must be publication-quality (300 DPI, clear labels)

**File locations:**
- New code → Code/ directory
- New results → Results/ directory
- New figures → Results/ directory (as .png and .pdf)

**CRITICAL:** Verify new figure paths using Glob before writing LaTeX

**CRITICAL:** All new figures MUST be:
1. Added to the Results section of the paper
2. Referenced in the text (e.g., "As shown in Figure X...")
3. Discussed with interpretation of what the figure shows

DELIVERABLE: New analysis results ready for integration

---

## STEP 5: METHODOLOGY CLARIFICATION (if needed)

**Execute if:** Feedback questions methodology or requests more detail

1. Locate methodology section in previous version
2. Use Edit tool to add clarifications
3. Add subsections if needed (using \\subsection{})
4. Include additional details about:
   - Data collection
   - Experimental procedures
   - Statistical methods
   - Validation approaches

**CRITICAL:** Use Edit tool for targeted additions, not full rewrites

DELIVERABLE: Enhanced methodology section

---

## STEP 6: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ENHANCEMENT

Based on feedback, enhance results and discussion:

1. **Locate sections to revise** in previous version
2. **Use Edit tool** to make targeted improvements:
   - Add missing interpretations
   - Strengthen theoretical connections
   - Expand implications
   - Address limitations more thoroughly
   - Add new results from STEP 4 (if applicable)

3. **Preserve existing content:**
   - Keep all existing tables
   - Keep all existing figures
   - Maintain all existing results
   - Add, don't replace

4. **If new figures were generated in STEP 4:**
   - Add \includegraphics{} for each new figure in the Results section
   - Add figure caption explaining what the figure shows
   - Add text discussing the figure: "As shown in Figure X, the results indicate..."
   - Ensure figure is placed near the text that references it

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Deleting existing results
- Removing existing figures/tables
- Rewriting entire sections from scratch
- Generating figures without including them in the paper

**REQUIRED:**
- Use Edit tool for modifications
- Preserve paragraph structure
- Maintain narrative flow
- Add smoothly to existing content
- Include ALL new figures from STEP 4 in Results section with discussion

DELIVERABLE: Enhanced results and discussion sections

---

## STEP 7: PAPER REVISION

⚠️ CRITICAL: REVISION REQUIREMENTS

**STEP 7.1 - VERIFY FIGURE PATHS BEFORE REVISING:**

1. Extract all existing figure paths:
   grep "includegraphics" <previous-version>.tex

2. For EACH path, verify file still exists:
   Use Glob with exact path

3. If ANY file not found:
   - Find correct location: Glob **/figname.png
   - Note correct path for use in revised version

**STEP 7.2 - CREATE NEW VERSION:**

1. Copy previous version to new version number (replace {participantId} with actual ID):
   Windows: copy Paper\icis_paper_{participantId}_v2.tex Paper\icis_paper_{participantId}_v3.tex
   Linux: cp Paper/icis_paper_{participantId}_v2.tex Paper/icis_paper_{participantId}_v3.tex

2. Read the new version file completely

3. Use Edit tool ONLY for revisions:
   - Add new content based on feedback
   - Improve clarity of existing content
   - Add new citations
   - Integrate new results
   - Add new figures (with verified paths)

**STEP 7.3 - INTEGRATION GUIDELINES:**

**For New Figures:**
- Verify location first: Glob **/new_fig.png
- Calculate relative path from Paper/ directory
- Add using verified path: ../Results/new_fig.png

**For Text Additions:**
- Use Edit tool to insert new paragraphs
- Maintain 150-250 word paragraph length
- Use transitional phrases
- Preserve surrounding content

**For Clarifications:**
- Use Edit tool to expand existing explanations
- Add details without changing core message
- Keep existing structure

**WRITING REQUIREMENTS:**

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Using Write tool (destroys existing content)
- Deleting existing figures/tables
- Removing existing results
- Bullet points in body (except: data characteristics, criteria, conditions)
- Paragraphs <100 words
- \\subsubsection{} commands

**REQUIRED:**
- Use Edit tool exclusively
- Paragraphs 150-250 words minimum
- Flowing narrative with transitions
- ONLY \\section{} and \\subsection{} headings
- Preserve all existing empirical content

**PAGE REQUIREMENTS (consistent with ICISbuilder):**
- 14-16 pages total (all sections including Results, Discussion)

**Academic Style:** See Appendix D for detailed guidelines

**After revising, verify:**
□ Previous version read completely
□ Only Edit tool used (never Write)
□ All previous figures preserved
□ All previous tables preserved
□ All previous results preserved
□ New content added based on feedback
□ If new figures generated in STEP 4: ALL are included in Results section
□ Each new figure is referenced in text (e.g., "As shown in Figure X...")
□ Page count correct: 14-16 pages
□ Bullet points ≤ 3 locations
□ Average paragraph ≥ 150 words
□ No \\subsubsection{}
□ Smooth narrative flow
□ Figures compile (see compilation check below)

**FIGURE COMPILATION CHECK:**
After first pdflatex run, verify:
- Look for: [page <../Results/fig1.png>] for EACH figure
- If "File not found" appears: Use Glob to find correct paths, Edit to update, recompile
- Check PDF size: Should be >450KB with images
- Compare to previous version figure count

DELIVERABLE: Revised LaTeX paper with all improvements

---

## STEP 8: FINAL VERIFICATION AND COMPILATION

⚠️ CRITICAL: COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION

**Compilation:**
Run pdflatex twice to resolve references

**Generate Verification Report comparing previous and current ContentInventory:**

The verification report should check:

**Check 1 - Content Preservation (compareFigureCounts, compareTableCounts):**
□ Figures: previousInventory.figureCount → currentInventory.figureCount (should not decrease)
□ Tables: previousInventory.tableCount → currentInventory.tableCount (should not decrease)
□ Pages: previousInventory.pageCount → currentInventory.pageCount
□ All empirical results still present
□ No content deleted (unless explicitly requested)

**Check 2 - Figure Rendering (verifyFigureRendering, verifyPDFFileSize):**
□ Compilation output shows: [page <path>] for each figure
□ No "File not found" warnings
□ PDF file size thresholds:
  - WITHOUT images: 250-350 KB
  - WITH images: 450-600 KB
  - If <350 KB with 2+ figures: Images NOT embedded - fix paths!
□ All figures from previous version still render
□ New figures (if any) also render

**Check 3 - Feedback Addressed (checkFeedbackAddressed):**
□ All major issues from feedbackAddressed[] have status: 'addressed'
□ Most minor issues addressed
□ Changes documented with response field in FeedbackItem

**Check 4 - Quality Standards:**
□ Page count correct: 14-16 pages
□ References compile correctly
□ No \\subsubsection{} commands
□ Smooth narrative flow maintained
□ New content integrated smoothly

**Check 5 - Section Content Validation (MANDATORY):**

⚠️ CRITICAL: Verify ALL required sections exist and contain substantive content.

**5a. Verify All Required Sections Exist:**
```
grep "\\section{" icis_paper_{participantId}_v{N}.tex
```

Required sections (ALL must be present):
1. Introduction
2. Literature Review (or Related Work)
3. Theoretical Framework (or Theory)
4. Methodology (or Method)
5. **Results** (or Findings)
6. Discussion
7. Conclusion

**5b. Validate Section Content Requirements:**

| Section | Min Words | Min Figs | Min Tables | Required Elements |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Introduction | 500 | - | - | Problem, gap, contributions |
| Literature Review | 800 | - | - | 15+ citations, themes |
| Theoretical Framework | 600 | - | - | Theory, hypotheses (H1, H2...) |
| Methodology | 600 | - | - | Design, data, measures |
| **Results** | **500** | **2** | **1** | **Statistical findings, figures** |
| Discussion | 400 | - | - | Implications, limitations |
| Conclusion | 200 | - | - | Summary, future research |

**5c. Results Section Special Validation:**
The Results section MUST contain:
□ At least 2 figures (\\includegraphics commands)
□ At least 1 table (\\begin{table} environment)
□ Statistical results (effect sizes, p-values, confidence intervals)
□ Reference to each figure ("As shown in Figure 1...")
□ Interpretation connected to hypotheses

Count figures in Results:
```
# Extract Results section and count figures
sed -n '/\\section{Results}/,/\\section{/p' icis_paper_{participantId}_v{N}.tex | grep -c "includegraphics"
```

**5d. Section Validation Checklist:**
□ All 7 sections present with headers
□ Introduction ≥500 words
□ Literature Review ≥800 words with ≥15 citations
□ Theoretical Framework ≥600 words with hypotheses
□ Methodology ≥600 words
□ **Results ≥500 words with ≥2 figures and ≥1 table**
□ Discussion ≥400 words
□ Conclusion ≥200 words

**If ANY section is missing or below threshold:** STOP and add content before finalizing.

**RECOVERY PROCEDURE - If Figures Are Placeholder Boxes:**

If after compilation you see placeholder boxes instead of images:

1. **Diagnose the problem:**
   Check compilation output for "File not found" warnings
   Note which files are missing

2. **Find actual file locations:**
   For each missing file, use Glob:
   Glob: **/fig1_main_comparison.png

   Record where files actually are

3. **Calculate correct relative paths:**
   From: {ICIS_PATH}\Paper\icis_paper_{participantId}_v3.tex
   To: {ICIS_PATH}\Results\fig1.png
   Path: ../Results/fig1.png

4. **Update ALL figure paths in LaTeX:**
   Use Edit tool to update each \includegraphics path:

   Find: \includegraphics{Results/old_path/fig1.png}
   Replace: \includegraphics{../Results/fig1.png}

   Repeat for each figure

5. **Recompile and verify:**
   Run: pdflatex icis_paper_{participantId}_v3.tex
   Check for: [11 <../Results/fig1.png>]
   Verify: No "File not found" warnings

6. **Check PDF file size:**
   Should be >450KB if images embedded
   Compare to previous version size

7. **Visual check (if possible):**
   Open PDF and verify images display, not boxes

Only proceed when ALL figures render correctly

**Final Deliverables:**
□ Revised paper (.tex + .pdf)
□ All figures rendered correctly
□ New code (if any) in Code/
□ New results (if any) in Results/
□ Response to reviewers document (optional)

DELIVERABLE: Publication-ready revised PDF

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW (revision iteration)

1. **Preserve:** Read previous version, catalog all content
2. **Analyze:** Understand feedback, prioritize issues
3. **Plan:** Create revision strategy
4. **Implement:** Make targeted improvements using Edit tool
5. **Verify:** Ensure nothing lost, everything renders
6. **Finalize:** Confirm all feedback addressed

**Key Points:**
- ALWAYS use Edit tool for revisions
- NEVER use Write tool (destroys existing content)
- Preserve ALL existing empirical content
- Verify figure paths before and after revision
- Compare previous and current versions
- Track what was added, not replaced

---

## COMMON PITFALLS - REVISIONS

### Pitfall 1: Using Write Tool Instead of Edit Tool

**Symptoms:**
- Previous content completely replaced
- Figures/tables disappeared
- Results sections gone
- Bibliography wiped out

**Cause:** Using Write tool creates entirely new file, destroying all previous work.

**Prevention:**
- ALWAYS use Edit tool for revisions
- NEVER use Write tool on existing papers
- Read previous version first
- Make targeted edits only

**Recovery:**
- If content lost, start over from previous version
- Copy previous version to new name
- Use Edit tool exclusively

---

### Pitfall 2: Figure Paths Break During Revision

**Symptoms:**
- Figures worked in v2
- Figures show as boxes in v3
- No new experiments run
- Same figure files exist

**Cause:**
- Copied old paths with hardcoded timestamps
- Used absolute paths
- Didn't verify paths before revising

**Solution:**
1. Before revising, extract all paths: grep "includegraphics"
2. Verify each path: Glob <path>
3. Update any broken paths before revising
4. Use relative paths: ../Results/
5. Test compilation before adding new content

---

### Pitfall 3: Deleting Content "To Make Room"

**Symptoms:**
- Previous figures/tables removed
- Results sections shortened
- Experiments deleted
- Paper got shorter instead of longer

**Cause:** Misunderstanding that revisions should ADD, not replace.

**Prevention:**
- Revisions ADD and IMPROVE
- Only delete if explicitly requested in feedback
- Compress existing content if needed, don't delete
- Use Edit tool to insert new content alongside old

**Recovery:**
- Restore deleted content from previous version
- Integrate rather than replace
- If page limit exceeded, compress discussion, not results

---

### Pitfall 4: Rewriting Entire Sections

**Symptoms:**
- Entire sections replaced with new text
- Original argument structure lost
- Reviewers can't see what changed
- Existing citations removed

**Cause:** Over-revision, rewriting instead of targeted improvements.

**Prevention:**
- Make minimal targeted changes
- Address specific feedback points
- Preserve argument structure
- Add to existing paragraphs, don't replace
- Use Edit tool for surgical changes

# APPENDIX B: REVISION-SPECIFIC BEST PRACTICES

## Golden Rules for Revisions
1. **Preserve First:** Always read and catalog existing content before making changes
2. **Edit, Don't Rewrite:** Use Edit tool for surgical improvements, not wholesale replacements
3. **Add, Don't Subtract:** Revisions should make papers better by adding, not by removing
4. **Verify Constantly:** Check figure paths, content preservation, PDF rendering throughout
5. **Track Changes:** Document what was added and why

## Common Revision Scenarios

# APPENDIX D: WRITING STYLE GUIDE

## Paragraph Development
- Target: 150-250 words (6-10 sentences)
- Develop ONE main idea thoroughly
- Use transition sentences between paragraphs
- Avoid choppy 1-2 sentence paragraphs

## Subsection Minimization
- Use \\section{} only for major divisions
- Use \\subsection{} only when necessary
- NO \\subsubsection{} - integrate into flowing paragraphs
- Maximum 2 heading levels in most sections

## Narrative Cohesion
- Transitional phrases: "Building on this," "Moreover," "Consequently"
- Signposting: "We now turn to," "Having established X"
- Link sentences with pronouns, synonyms, connecting phrases

## Examples

❌ **Fragmented:**
```
\\subsubsection{Route 1}
Control enhances ownership.

\\subsubsection{Route 2}
Familiarity breeds ownership.
```

✅ **Flowing:**
```
Three routes develop psychological ownership. First, controlling the target enhances feelings as individuals exercise decisions over use. Second, intimately knowing develops through deep engagement and familiarity. Third, self-investment incorporates objects into extended self-concept.
```

|-------|-------|-------------|
| 6 | Strong Accept | Technically flawless paper with groundbreaking impact on one or more areas of AI, suitable for oral presentation |
| 5 | Accept | Technically solid paper with high impact on at least one sub-area of AI, good enough for spotlight presentation |
| 4 | Borderline Accept | Technically solid work where acceptance reasons outweigh rejection factors |
| 3 | Borderline Reject | Technically solid work where rejection reasons outweigh acceptance factors |
| 2 | Reject | Technical flaws, weak evaluation, inadequate reproducibility, or incompletely addressed ethical considerations |
| 1 | Strong Reject | Presents well-known results or contains unaddressed ethical concerns |

## Core Evaluation Dimensions (4-point scale each)

### 1. Quality (Technical Soundness)
| Score | Level |
|-------|-------|
| 4 | Excellent - Claims fully substantiated, methods appropriate, technically sound |
| 3 | Good - Minor issues but overall sound |
| 2 | Fair - Some technical concerns or gaps |
| 1 | Poor - Significant technical flaws |

**Evaluate:**
• Are claims properly substantiated?
• Are methods appropriate for the problem?
• Is the work complete and thorough?
• Are authors honest about strengths and weaknesses?
• Are proofs correct (if applicable)?
• Is statistical analysis valid?

### 2. Clarity (Presentation)
| Score | Level |
|-------|-------|
| 4 | Excellent - Exceptionally clear writing and organization |
| 3 | Good - Well-written with minor issues |
| 2 | Fair - Understandable but needs improvement |
| 1 | Poor - Difficult to follow |

**Evaluate:**
• Is the paper well-written?
• Is it well-organized?
• Is there sufficient information for reproducibility?
• Are figures and tables clear and informative?

### 3. Significance (Impact)
| Score | Level |
|-------|-------|
| 4 | Excellent - High potential impact on the field |
| 3 | Good - Meaningful contribution |
| 2 | Fair - Incremental contribution |
| 1 | Poor - Limited significance |

**Evaluate:**
• Will this work be adopted by the community?
• Does it advance the state of the art?
• Does it contribute new knowledge?
• Will it influence future research?

### 4. Originality (Novelty)
| Score | Level |
|-------|-------|
| 4 | Excellent - Highly novel contribution |
| 3 | Good - Novel aspects with clear differentiation |
| 2 | Fair - Some novelty but largely incremental |
| 1 | Poor - Little to no novelty |

**Evaluate:**
• Does the paper provide novel insights?
• Is it clearly differentiated from prior work?
• Does it introduce new tasks, methods, or perspectives?
• Note: Originality includes work that evaluates existing methods with novel insights, or demonstrates improved efficiency, fairness, etc.

## Confidence Scale (5-point)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Absolutely certain; very familiar with related work |
| 4 | Confident but not absolutely certain |
| 3 | Fairly confident; possible unfamiliarity with some related work |
| 2 | Willing to defend assessment but likely have understanding gaps |
| 1 | Educated guess; review is outside primary expertise area |

## Required Review Components

### Summary
• Write in your own words what the paper accomplishes
• Be objective and descriptive

### Strengths
• List specific strong points
• Be thorough and substantive

### Weaknesses
• List specific weak points
• Provide evidence for each criticism
• When claiming lack of novelty, provide appropriate references

### Questions for Authors (3-5 required)
• Provide actionable questions
• State clearly what answer would change your evaluation
• Focus on clarifying critical issues

### Limitations Assessment
• Evaluate whether authors adequately discuss limitations
• Consider scope, generalizability, and potential negative impacts

### Ethical Concerns
• Flag any ethical issues requiring attention
• Consider societal impact and dual-use concerns

## Review Best Practices

• Avoid superficial, uninformed reviews without evidence
• Focus on technical aspects rather than only paper organization or grammar
• Provide constructive feedback that helps authors improve
• Be respectful and professional
• Do not use sub-reviewers
• Execute code only in secure environments (Docker, VM, isolated cloud)
• Maintain confidentiality until publication

## Common Technical Issues to Evaluate

• Experimental methodology and baselines
• Statistical significance and error bars
• Reproducibility (code, data, hyperparameters documented)
• Ablation studies
• Comparison with state-of-the-art
• Computational requirements
• Generalization claims
• Theoretical correctness (proofs, assumptions)
